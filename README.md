# Ball-Run-Unity-Game

**_A simple game created while learning the basics of Unity and the C# language._**

The object of the game is very basic; dodge the giant balls while running away from the guard, who will hunt you down relentlessly.

To start: Open in Unity, navigate to Assets > Scenes > StartScene.
